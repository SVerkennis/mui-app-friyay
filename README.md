Friyaay Exercise, React and Material UI :tada:

Let's design and code a simple single-page application with Material UI and feed it some data either from an API (or if you get really far, your own backend). The goal of this exercise is to learn React basics and how to implement a UI framework such as Material UI. Both of these systems have their own rules and principles and the aim is to make your app work with them.
Good luck, happy hacking, ask questions, take breaks
Make a plan, see what components might be useful, don't go too far:
scribble, draw, brainstorm
plan your site so you have some steps to follow
got a back-end that you want to connect? Plan you front-end accordingly ;)
read the documentation, step by step

This is a good example for a simple website using MUI
You can check out the components sourcecode here
Setup a new project with CRA (Create React App), remove starter code and install dependencies:
npx create-react-app give-it-a-good-name
 open the project folder
create a GitHub repository
push your project to GitHub (don't forget to add .idea & *.iml to the .gitignore )
after switching to a new branch, remove starter code and
install Material UI -> link to docs
push, merge, pull

Please use git and GitHub, it's an important skill and can help with structuring your approach. :beten:
Write your website's foundation
The next thing you should do is implement a basic structure for the site:
For example the header and an element that aligns your main content
The header could be an Appbar with nothing but a title in it
Also a good opportunity to implement a Grid for your main content
Before you connect a backend your frontend should either be ready to display the data or at least log it to the console
Next steps
Add components
Add React Router :kopf√ºber:
Change all the colors (MUI Palette)
Add Content, write/connect a back-end
